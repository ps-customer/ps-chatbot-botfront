# Setup

<Important type="warning">
  Botfront is multi-project since Botfront 1.x. This feature is more useful on a hosted environment than on a local machine where it's more convenient to have one project per folder. Hence this process might seem a bit convoluted 
</Important>


## Requirements

Botfront has a few technical requirements. See them [here](/docs/deployment/configuration/#indicative-minimal-technical-requirements).

- Linux or macOS (Windows may work but is not officially supported yet, [help is welcome](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/issues/115))
- Chrome (some issues with other browsers)
- A recent version of Docker
- A recent version of Node.js

## Install the Botfront CLI

```bash
npm install -g botfront
```

## Create a new project folder


```bash
botfront init
```

Botfront will prompt you for a folder name if the current directory is not empty

## Start Botfront

```bash
botfront up
```

Botfront will download Docker images and then start. Botfront will open in your browser.

Then, in your terminal (from the project folder):

```
 
Congrats! Your project is now ready!
